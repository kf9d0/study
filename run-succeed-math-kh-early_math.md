##### Counting with small numbers
Put seven squirrels() in the box. All right, so that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven squirrels. I've put seven squirrels in the box. Let's keep going, this is lots of fun. Put four squirrels in the box. That's even easier than putting seven. One, two, three, four. I just click() on the suqirrel and then drag it into the box. All right, hopefully we see more animals. Oh, here we go, horses. Put nine horses in the box. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine horses. It's a lot of fun.
