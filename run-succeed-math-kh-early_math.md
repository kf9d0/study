##### Counting with small numbers
Put seven **squirrels** in the box. All right, so that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven squirrels. I've put seven squirrels in the box. Let's keep going, this is lots of fun. Put four squirrels in the box. That's even easier than putting seven. One, two, three, four. I just **click** on the squirrel and then drag it into the box. All right, hopefully we see more animals. Oh, here we go, horses. Put nine horses in the box. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine horses. It's a lot of fun.

How do we count the flowers? So, this first choice, they go one, two, three, and then they don't count this one and then they skip it and they go four, five, six, and then they skip this one again, and then they say seven, eight. That's not how you count flowers! You'd sya this is four, this is five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So, this first choice is not right. Now, the second one looks better. One, two, three, four, they didn't skip this one, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That one looks good so I'll click right over here and check my answer. How do we count the mice? Let's see, one, two, this isn't the third mouse! This is the second mouse! This is crazy, this isn't right. All right, this one over here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, this is right. Up here they skipped the nubmer two, this should be the second mouse, not the third mouse! All right. Let's keep going. Type the missing numbers. It says count the ladybugs. Type the missing numbers in the boxes. All right, this is ladybug number one. Two, then let me type three, then let me type four. It's a lot of fun. Count the flowers. Type the missing numbers in the boxes. This is flower number one, flower nubmer two. Just gonna **type** that right in there. Check it, let me do one more. How do we count the flowers? So, we saw one like this a few questions ago. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, **10**. That one looks good. This one, just like the last time, they skipped, **actually** they skipped the same ones. This wouldn't be the right way to do it. So, we select this one right here, and then we're done.
